      header: Create your website and get ready to discover the best ideas...
      step1: "Step 1: Create your website"
      step1_exp:   "For example, \"Which do you want more from the student government?\""
      step2: "Step 2: Choose your URL"

      p1: "To create a site the first thing you'll need to do is pick a question. This question is what visitors to your site will see. For example, your question could be \"Which is the best way to improve campus life?\" or \"Which do you think is more important for us to do?\""
      p2: Now you'll need to pick the url ending that is associated with your question; this is how you'll spread the word about your question.

    about: About this project
    p1: All Our Ideas is a research project to develop a new form of social data collection that combines the best features of quantitative and qualitative methods. Using the power of the web, we are creating a data collection tool that has the scale, speed, and quantification of a survey while still allowing for new information to "bubble up" from respondents as happens in interviews, participant observation, and focus groups.
    p2: "The All Our Ideas team is lead by Matthew Salganik from the Department of Sociology at Princeton University. Current and former team members include: Peter Lubell-Doughtie, Nadia Heninger, Bill Zeller, Josh Weinstein, Dhwani Shah, Bambi Tsui, and Adam Sanders."
    p3: Because All Our Ideas is a research project, we will be analyzing the data that you create. However, we will respect your privacy, and we will never sell your data to anyone. These issues are described more fully in our privacy policy.

    collect: Collect and sort suggestions effectively
    p1: Just as Wikipedia is a platform that allows groups to collaboratively write an encyclopedia, All Our Ideas is a platform that allows groups to collect and prioritize ideas in a transparent, democratic, and bottom-up process. Itâ€™s a suggestion box for the digital age.
    p2: To see how All Our Ideas works, weâ€™ll walk through a specific example. Imagine that you are the president of the Undergraduate Student Government at Princeton and you need to find the issues of greatest concern to the student body. Everyone is telling you what they want, but nobody fills out surveys so you donâ€™t know how widespread the support for any of these ideas really is. Plus, how do you even know if your student priority survey includes all the important ideas?
    p3: This is a natural problem for All Our Ideas system of voting and soliciting suggestions. Once the platform for collaboration was created, more than 2,000 students contributed more than 40,000 votes and uploaded more than 100 new suggestions.
    p4: "You can create such a platform for collaboration for your group in a few easy steps. In the end we are going to help you create something that looks like this:"
    step1: "Step 1: Create a website"
    step1_txt: 'Pick a question that voters see. For example, "Which do you want more?"'
    step2: "Step 2: Pick a URL"
    step2_txt: 'Pick a "quick url" that will take visitors to your site. For example, if the undergraduate student government wanted people to go to www.allourideas.org/usg they would have picked the quick url "usg".'
    step3: "Step 3: Upload Ideas"
    step3_txt: Upload some ideas. For example, the student government started about 200 with ideas such as lower textbook prices, extend library hours, and outdoor hammocks. The more ideas the better because the voting process will help you find the best ones.
    step4: "Step 4: Spread your URL"
    step4_txt: "Spread your url and watch what happens. You can get an idea of what the final product looks like by trying it below:"
